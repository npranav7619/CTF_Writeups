## Cotopaxi Guide
### A guide on how IoT protocols work and how to use cotopaxi

    New Protocol like CoAP,DTLS,MQTT were introduced and old ones like UPnP ,SSDP were removed
    
    CoAP :

    Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a specialized web transfer protocol for use with 
    constrained nodes and constrained networks in the Internet of Things. 
    CoAP is designed to enable simple, constrained devices to join the IoT even through constrained 
    networks with low bandwidth and low availability.
    
    This is CoAP message format :

    DTLS : 
    
    DTLS stands for Datagram Transport Layer Security. Itâ€™s a session layer communications 
    protocol designed to protect data privacy. 
    It allows datagram-based applications to communicate while preventing tampering, eavesdropping, and 
    message forgery.
    Although DTLS is based on TLS, they are two different things. Whereas DTLS is built on UDP, TLS uses 
    Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)    

    MQTT : 

    MQTT is a standards-based messaging protocol, or set of rules, used for machine-to-machine
    communication. Smart sensors,
    wearables, and other Internet of Things (IoT) devices typically have to transmit and receive data
    over a resource-constrained network with limited bandwidth. 
    These IoT devices use MQTT for data transmission, as it is easy to implement 
    and can communicate IoT data efficiently. 
    MQTT supports messaging between devices to the cloud and the cloud to the device.
    
    MQTT-SN is MQTT Sensor Network protocol
    Its a UDP based clone of MQTT 
    Minor changes in packet formats 
    
    QUIC : 
    
    Quick UDP Internet Connections
    Created by google and widely used by google apps and its UDP based
    


    These protocols were not tested by security testing tools.

    This is where cotopaxi comes into play.
    This Tool has mutiple purposes like 
      Find active endpoints
      Identify network traffic
      fuzz components or interfaces
      test traffic amplification
    
    
    The Toolkits in cotopaxi
      
    Reconnaissance Phase : 

    Service Ping : 

    Checking availability of network services
    Identifies active service endpoints 
    Better than standard tools because nmap and wireshark do not recognize
    IoT traffic on non standard ports
    
    Security Scanner : 
    Verifing security settings (ciphersuites and certificates)

    Software fingerprinting : 
    The software used by the remote network server 
    Equvalent to nmap -sV
    Uses machine learning classfier 

    Resource Listing (dirbusting) : 
    Discovering resources identified by the given URLs
    Equivalent to Dirbuster for CoAP/mDNS/SSDP
    Has a list of URIs or services 

    Device Identification : 
    Passive analysis of traffic and device classification using Machine Learning
    Identification of IoT devices using captured traffic (PCAP format)
        

    Pre-Exploitatio Phase : 
    
    Amplification sniffing : 
    Detecting network traffic amplificaiton
    Calculates amplification factor (sizeout / sizein -1)
    should be placed on router or use network tap to see all traffic to/from target 

    Protocol Fuzzing : 
    Fuzzing impletementation of protocols
    checks service ping before and after sending payload
    in verbose mode displays payload and response packet.
    
    Vulnerability testing : 
    Identifying known vulnerabilities 
    5 classes
    information disclosure : unauthorized access to internal information
    crash (DoS) : leads to crash of server 
    traffic amplification : responses larger than request
    memory leak : server wastes memory after processing the payload   so it requires manual confirmation
    remote code execution : currently only deteced as crash
    

   ### Installation 
        
        pip install cotopaxi
    
        or install from source 

           git clone https://github.com/Samsung/cotopaxi 
           cd cotopaxi
           python setup.py install

   ### Usage 
        
      Start the services by opening separately
      
      python -m cotopaxi.service_ping -h

      python -m cotopaxi.resource_listing -h
