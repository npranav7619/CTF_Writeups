    Cotopaxi Guide
    A guide on how IoT protocols work and how to use cotopaxi 
    New Protocol like CoAP,DTLS,MQTT were introduced and old ones like UPnP ,SSDP were removed
    
    CoAP :

    Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a specialized web transfer protocol for use with 
    constrained nodes and constrained networks in the Internet of Things. 
    CoAP is designed to enable simple, constrained devices to join the IoT even through constrained 
    networks with low bandwidth and low availability.
    
    DTLS : 
    
    DTLS stands for Datagram Transport Layer Security. Itâ€™s a session layer communications 
    protocol designed to protect data privacy. 
    It allows datagram-based applications to communicate while preventing tampering, eavesdropping, and 
    message forgery.
    Although DTLS is based on TLS, they are two different things. Whereas DTLS is built on UDP, TLS uses 
    Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)    

    MQTT : 

    MQTT is a standards-based messaging protocol, or set of rules, used for machine-to-machine
    communication. Smart sensors,
    wearables, and other Internet of Things (IoT) devices typically have to transmit and receive data
    over a resource-constrained network with limited bandwidth. 
    These IoT devices use MQTT for data transmission, as it is easy to implement 
    and can communicate IoT data efficiently. 
    MQTT supports messaging between devices to the cloud and the cloud to the device.
    
    MQTT-SN is MQTT Sensor Network protocol
    Its a UDP based clone of MQTT 
    Minor changes in packet formats 
    
    QUIC : 
    
    Quick UDP Internet Connections
    Created by google and widely used by google apps and its UDP based

    These protocols were not tested by security testing tools.

    This is where cotopaxi comes into play.
    This Tool has mutiple purposes like 
      Find active endpoints
      Identify network traffic
      fuzz components or interfaces
      test traffic amplification
    
    
    The Toolkits in cotopaxi
      
    Reconnaissance Phase : 

    Service Ping : 

    Checking availability of network services
    Identifies active service endpoints 
    Better than standard tools because nmap and wireshark do not recognize IoT traffic on non standard ports
    
    Security Scanner : Verifing security settings (ciphersuites and certificates)
    Software fingerprinting : The software used by the remote network server 
    Resource Listing (dirbusting) : Discovering resources identified by the given URLs
    Device Identification : Passive analysis of traffic and device classification using Machine Learning

    Pre-Exploitatio Phase : 
    
    Amplification sniffing : detecting network traffic amplificaiton
    Protocol Fuzzing : Fuzzing impletementation of protocols
    Vulnerability testing : Identifying known vulnerabilities
