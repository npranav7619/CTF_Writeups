						What is a Kernel ?
					
						- Kernel is like a piece of software that exists within the OS that controls all major functions.
						- Acts as an interface between hardware and user applications
						- Contains many built-in drivers and system calls.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Types of Kernels
						
						- Microkernels
							- Most services like device drivers, file systems, and network stacks run in user space as separate processes
							- Since services run in user space, failures in one service do not necessarily crash the entire system, enhancing stability
							- Easier to extend and maintain since components can be added, removed, or updated independently
							- Examples : MINIX, GNU Hurd
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						- Monolithic Kernels
							- All OS services, including device drivers, file systems, and network stacks, run in kernel space
							- Monolithic kernels often have extensive support for a wide range of hardware devices, as device drivers are integrated directly into the kernel
							- Examples : Linux, BSD
