# Digital Defenders CTF 2023 

This was 3 day national level CTF organized by bi0s[https://bi0s.in/], Cisco and CysecK which was really intriguing . I ended up getting **12th** place.
So writeup covers some of the interesting challenges from the CTF.

Digital Forenscis was the most intresting cateogry in my opinion.
